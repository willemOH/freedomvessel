			What is a Freedom Vessel? I came up with the name, but other people have them too. No, there isn't a secret tribe of roving tall bikes (and I've been sworn to secrecy anyways). It's not really about my bike, <i>Tall Dreams</i>, which there <i> is </i> only one of because I made it this past autumn. A Freedom Vessel is whatever lets you be free in a world where nothing is free (or so says a world created to work this way). I would put all homes that can take you with them under this title: vans, houseboats, tiny homes on wheels, submarines, whatever. It is the solution that I see many people finding to one of those problems only humans have (and recent in our time): the debt of existance.<br><br> To exist, one needs somewhere to lay their head at night, cook a meal, keep some tools, etc. But the issue is that all the places have been claimed and you have to do something for whoever claimed that place in order to do the home things there. That might be a land-lord or body of government that wants payment for the priviledge to exist in their place. Fine, but what if in order to get this payment, you have to do things you don't think are worth doing? Well there isn't a lot of room there for choice. It's a serious lack of freedom that exists in every part of the world. But what room there is I want to use. Because I've learned that doing only what is important to me makes my life a lot better. <br><br>If my home can move then I am not commited to any debt towards whoever's land it rests on. I built this bike to give me the freedom to do what I want, what feels worthwhile to me and contributes to the world that I want. I am not opposed to working or even giving payment to land-owners. I just want a choice. To choose my debts and live as independently or dependently as I am capable of. And in my journey to be free, I have found I am capable of a lot. <br><br> But you probably just wanted to know about the bike: My bike is a tall cargo bike with the completely unique (as far as I know) feature of having a fold out bed built in (pictured below). So if it must be named and known, I would call it a tall cargo bed bike. As a Freedom Vessel, it is as low cost to maintain as I can figure besides a backpack and legs. Another unique feature is that it cannot be bought. Such a bike must be made. Happiness and tall bikes, two things money cannot buy and so two things that are definitely in the world that I want.

	This blog chronicles my journeys on <i>Tall Dreams</i>, my Freedom Vessel. And keeps my parents from calling the police if I don't text them for a couple days. Wish me luck.
