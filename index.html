			I write now from within my bike. It will rain tomorrow and so I have put   a rain fly from a tent over my bike, covering everything except the peak. Handle bars  sprouting six feet high out of a pale green mass. But it is dark and I hope no one can see that sight as I am trespassing. Considering the words of my last post, this is hard not to do without some forethought. And this week will have little of that. It's actually part of a smart plan which I cannot take credit for: to actually test this whole living on (and in) a bike idea. I am on a 10 day loop out of Asheville NC and then back for the holidays. I will set out for a much longer one in January. Yes I would have liked to been starting out in October as I had planned but that didn't happen (painting the bike and the best thanksgiving of my life did). Adventure has no off-season. Which brings me back to the babbling brook to my left and the cars that come up this shared driveway for which I must cover my light so they don't worry about the illuminated tent of an unknown trespasser.<br><br>
	In the hilly city of Asheville, making rounds in the children's dentist's parking lot, the grinding a ripping of gears put the mood in my mind that this whole bike voyage was properly doomed. That's what first days are for. When home is still not too far away and you can throw in the towel and say "I tried". But I have the advantage here of not having a plan B. My bike is my stability, my soverign home, until find something else to give me stability such as work that I want. But it's hard to get work that I want without having some stability to approach from. A position of not needing but only of wanting. So there in the dentist's parking lot I gave my bike a thorough tune up and it turned out on the four greyhounds from Maine, some key screws had gotten a little loose. But doesn't the wild west of bus trasnportation do that to everybody, bike or human? Then I cranked up Biltmore Ave and every other hill that got in my way. I did 10 miles today mostly in first gear (and sometimes in foot gear). But melodies of "WOW" and "What the fuck?" rang out in my wake and wide smiles behind car windows kept my spirits high as my grinning head (maybe 10 feet?). Even when I was stuck in second gear going up one of those hills without a top and the big black truck whom I had been waving back until I could find a shoulder ripped by me (politely after I got into a shoulder) with a modification I would expect from a squid more than an F-250. I just covered my ligtht as another resident of ritzy rural road returns home. This truck had an exhaust that seemed designed to fight road bikes. A giant shoulder sweeping chrome arm that spat n inky cloud, putting me in a cloud so thick I was worried more about seeing than breathing. It was cartoonish but#hen look at my bike. I don't know if he was trying to give the scared squid impression or if he had to be somewhere but I just knew in that moment, setting off into the unknown on my (another car) dream bike, I was  exactly where I wanted to be. But Idon't know if F-2Squiddy could say that. Y hands are getting a bit numb so I will end here and become very cozy in my sleeping bag.

			What is a Freedom Vessel? I came up with the name, but other people have them too. No, there isn't a secret tribe of roving tall bikes (and I've been sworn to secrecy anyways). It's not really about my bike, <i>Tall Dreams</i>, which there <i> is </i> only one of because I made it this past autumn. A Freedom Vessel is whatever lets you be free in a world where nothing is free (or so says a world created to work this way). I would put all homes that can take you with them under this title: vans, houseboats, tiny homes on wheels, submarines, whatever. It is the solution that I see many people finding to one of those problems only humans have (and recent in our time): the debt of existance.<br><br> To exist, one needs somewhere to lay their head at night, cook a meal, keep some tools, etc. But the issue is that all the places have been claimed and you have to do something for whoever claimed that place in order to do the home things there. That might be a land-lord or body of government that wants payment for the priviledge to exist in their place. Fine, but what if in order to get this payment, you have to do things you don't think are worth doing? Well there isn't a lot of room there for choice. It's a serious lack of freedom that exists in every part of the world. But what room there is I want to use. Because I've learned that doing only what is important to me makes my life a lot better. <br><br>If my home can move then I am not commited to any debt towards whoever's land it rests on. I built this bike to give me the freedom to do what I want, what feels worthwhile to me and contributes to the world that I want. I am not opposed to working or even giving payment to land-owners. I just want a choice. To choose my debts and live as independently or dependently as I am capable of. And in my journey to be free, I have found I am capable of a lot.

			But you probably just wanted to know about the bike: My bike is a tall cargo bike with the completely unique (as far as I know) feature of having a fold out bed built in (pictured below). So if it must be named and known, I would call it a tall cargo bed bike. As a Freedom Vessel, it is as low cost to maintain as I can figure besides a backpack and legs. Another unique feature is that it cannot be bought. Such a bike must be made. Happiness and tall bikes, two things money cannot buy and so two things that are definitely in the world that I want.

	This blog chronicles my journeys on <i>Tall Dreams</i>, my Freedom Vessel. And keeps my parents from calling the police if I don't text them for a couple days. Wish me luck.
