		<h2>Night two: wettest and worse</h2>
			<time datetime="12-10-2023">DEC. 10, 2023</time>
			<p>
			<i>"Somewhat safe and warm?"</i> was the text I saw at 3AM last night while I crounched in shelter under a row of bushes. No, I was neither of those things. It was my girlfriend Alexandra whose idea it had been to do a test outing. And though I found myself there in game over mode because of this idea, it was also because of this idea that it still was a game that I could quit and start again. Sort of. I still only get one life. Which is why I had just abandoned my bike and shelter and was estimating the number of feet I had to put between my soaking half-naked self and potential oblivion.<br><br> 
			It was 2AM when the whipping of my rainfly woke me. I groaned with the realization that I would have to hatch from my cocoon to do something about this. From the velcro straps inside where tent poles are usually attached I hung my helmet filled with bags of nuts and my foodbag from the other one. All still while mostly unhatched. With these weights holding the rainfly down, I was satisfied with that and that the rain which had been quite violent when I went to bed had only gotten me a little wet. And most importantly I was still quite warm. Synthetic sleeping bags are amazing. But none of that gave me comfort from the flash I then saw light up the edges of sky I could see from under my cover. I was sudenly very alert. Even more than the concerns of my tent flying away in the wind. I saw another flash. A little while later a faint rumble. As took in the changing weather with just my nose and wide eyes peeking out in the dark from my mummy bag, some very concerning thoughts came to me for the first time.<br><br>
			1. I was on the edge of an open field during a lightning storm. <br>
			2. My giant steel bike was taller than any bush bordering this field. <br>3. In my metal frame bed, I was sleeping inside of a fearless lightning rod. But I, the occupant of the fearless lightning rod, was not so fearless. Fear, when used well, can cut through all dreamy visions of true independence and fantastical bike living. It can make a person very smart.<br><br>
			I was at 10 missippis when I could feel my heart start to prepare for what my mind was yet to accept. At 7 missippis a moment later I finally accepted the lightning was moving closer, and fast. At 4 missippis I was exploding from my covered bed bike with anything I didn't want fried by what my entire body mind and spirit now accepted was coming to get a taste of tall bike. I ran now, half crouched (I don't have to be the lowest just lower than the nearest lightning rod) until I felt I was out of the blast radius. And then, fully crouched (I must be shorter than the second shortest thing too in case the lightning double dips with the same chip) in my long underwear and what I would have called a moment ago "the dry shoes", I doubted this estimate and ran that distance again before I could let myself consider what I would do now.<br><br>
	I could start knocking on doors. 3AM isn't the best time to solicit in underwear but if this had been the real journey, this would have been my best hope for survival now that the road was blurred with the increasing downpour, a shiver running through my saturated body, and coming in on the 1 missippi count. But this is just the test run. It's not for real so I wiped the water off my phone screen and called my mom. In the past week I had been staying with my mom, it was usually me who had to tell her that her phone was ringing as she had a knack for turning the volume down low and then leaving it in another room. But a mother's ears must be keenest at 3AM when the last thing she heard from her son was "I am settled down in a field tonight. Not sure where". And just an hour laterafter the missippi count was finding a groove in the 0s and I ran across the road to just not compete in the open field height contest at all, I was chattering in the passenger seat of a magical rescue vehicle and in bed mostly dry by 5. Thank you mom, thank you fear, thank you whipping rainfly for the wakeup. The test run resumes tomorrow with just a bit more knowledge than I had before.

			<h2> Day two: wet</h2>
			<time datetime="12-09-2023">DEC. 9, 2023</time>
		<p>
		When I devised the concept
		of a bed bike I promised myself I would never have to bike in the rain again. On the first sprinkle I would pull over, pull out the bed, and pull out a book, cozy and dry until the rain passed. I had not considered a rainy night and having to leave the next rainy morning because I parked somewhere beautiful but far too visible. One set of clothes and shoes down. <br><br>
	Before I awoke from a midday nap, across the road and painstakingly nestled into a thorny forest, I heard footsteps, two men chuckling outside my bike tent, I could feet my feet resting in a cool puddle at#he foot of my bed. I let out a woods-piercing scream in protest of being defeated despite my mucky struggles to hide and a new dry outfit. I had to listen to the raindrops plooping off my rainfly for a good two minutes from inside my cocoon bag before I could accept that these plights only existed in the space between a midday nap and a sun-peeking out reality. The drops stopped sounding like footsteps and my feet understood they were a little chilly, not wet. I still have a chance here. But I didn't like to think my chance to keep a pair of shoes dry would mean staying in my sleeping bag for the rest of the day and the day
	after. The rain is supposed to let up on monday. <br><br>
	After calling my mom to get the latest weather (I don't have a smartphone) and then making a mental note to make my computer capable of getting me an hourly rain report (my laptop is text-based), I decided to take a risk (while I can still get someone to bail me out) and bike. I don't know if it paid off but at least I'm not still in my bag.<br><br>
	I probably only made 9 miles today. 3 of which were in the wrong direction, 3 to ge back to where I started, and then 3 in sort of the right direction. But even when I was going the wrong way, the scenes of misty mountains and late day fields with stunning oxen laying about (I complimented one on his tall horns and he turned in acknowledgement (just because I'm holding up five cars doesn't mean I won't slow to say hello) reminded me that everything is better at 10 feet and 10 mph. My earlier grumbling in my sleeping bag regretting that I hadn't stuck my first idea, to make a bike trailer which would always be dry and available without the setup, dried up with the rain and I couldn't imagine a more enjoyable way to travel (once the brakes were fixed and the I made the front wheel stop wobbling).<br><br>
	Tonight I am in a field, where hopefully no one will bother me tomorrow during the rainstorm. I have also learned that rainflys do not actually stop water from getting in but just divert it to#he ground. So my less than tent shaped bike tent does suffer a few pooling leak throughs, like on the seat which towers over my head every night.

		<h2>first days are important</h2>
			<time datetime="12-08-2023">DEC. 8, 2023</time>
			<p>
			I write now from within my bike. It will rain tomorrow and so I have put   a rain fly from a tent over my bike, covering everything except the peak. Handle bars  sprouting six feet high out of a pale green mass. But it is dark and I hope no one can see that sight as I am trespassing. Considering the words of my last post, this is hard not to do without some forethought. And this week will have little of that. It's actually part of a smart plan which I cannot take credit for: to actually test this whole living on (and in) a bike idea. I am on a 10 day loop out of Asheville NC and then back for the holidays. I will set out for a much longer one in January. Yes I would have liked to been starting out in October as I had planned but that didn't happen (painting the bike and the best thanksgiving of my life did). Adventure has no off-season. Which brings me back to the babbling brook to my left and the cars that come up this shared driveway for which I must cover my light so they don't worry about the illuminated tent of an unknown trespasser.<br><br>
	In the hilly city of Asheville, making rounds in the children's dentist's parking lot, the grinding a ripping of gears put the mood in my mind that this whole bike voyage was properly doomed. That's what first days are for. When home is still not too far away and you can throw in the towel and say "I tried". But I have the advantage here of not having a plan B. My bike is my stability, my soverign home, until find something else to give me stability such as work that I want. But it's hard to get work that I want without having some stability to approach from. A position of not needing but only of wanting. So there in the dentist's parking lot I gave my bike a thorough tune up and it turned out on the four greyhounds from Maine, some key screws had gotten a little loose. But doesn't the wild west of bus trasnportation do that to everybody, bike or human? Then I cranked up Biltmore Ave and every other hill that got in my way. I did 10 miles today mostly in first gear (and sometimes in foot gear). But melodies of "WOW" and "What the fuck?" rang out in my wake and wide smiles behind car windows kept my spirits high as my grinning head (maybe 10 feet?). Even when I was stuck in second gear going up one of those hills without a top and the big black truck whom I had been waving back until I could find a shoulder ripped by me (politely after I got into a shoulder) with a modification I would expect from a squid more than an F-250. I just covered my light now as another resident of ritzy rural road returns home. This truck had an exhaust that seemed designed to fight road bikes. A giant shoulder sweeping chrome arm that spat n inky cloud, putting me in a cloud so thick I was worried more about seeing than breathing. It was cartoonish but then look at my bike. I don't know if he was trying to give the scared squid impression or if he had to be somewhere but I just knew in that moment, setting off into the unknown on my (another car) dream bike, I was  exactly where I wanted to be. But Idon't know if F-2Squiddy could say that. Y hands are getting a bit numb so I will end here and become very cozy in my sleeping bag.

			What is a Freedom Vessel? I came up with the name, but other people have them too. No, there isn't a secret tribe of roving tall bikes (and I've been sworn to secrecy anyways). It's not really about my bike, <i>Tall Dreams</i>, which there <i> is </i> only one of because I made it this past autumn. A Freedom Vessel is whatever lets you be free in a world where nothing is free (or so says a world created to work this way). I would put all homes that can take you with them under this title: vans, houseboats, tiny homes on wheels, submarines, whatever. It is the solution that I see many people finding to one of those problems only humans have (and recent in our time): the debt of existance.<br><br> To exist, one needs somewhere to lay their head at night, cook a meal, keep some tools, etc. But the issue is that all the places have been claimed and you have to do something for whoever claimed that place in order to do the home things there. That might be a land-lord or body of government that wants payment for the priviledge to exist in their place. Fine, but what if in order to get this payment, you have to do things you don't think are worth doing? Well there isn't a lot of room there for choice. It's a serious lack of freedom that exists in every part of the world. But what room there is I want to use. Because I've learned that doing only what is important to me makes my life a lot better. <br><br>If my home can move then I am not commited to any debt towards whoever's land it rests on. I built this bike to give me the freedom to do what I want, what feels worthwhile to me and contributes to the world that I want. I am not opposed to working or even giving payment to land-owners. I just want a choice. To choose my debts and live as independently or dependently as I am capable of. And in my journey to be free, I have found I am capable of a lot.

			But you probably just wanted to know about the bike: My bike is a tall cargo bike with the completely unique (as far as I know) feature of having a fold out bed built in (pictured below). So if it must be named and known, I would call it a tall cargo bed bike. As a Freedom Vessel, it is as low cost to maintain as I can figure besides a backpack and legs. Another unique feature is that it cannot be bought. Such a bike must be made. Happiness and tall bikes, two things money cannot buy and so two things that are definitely in the world that I want.
